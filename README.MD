## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is triggered on **push to `main`** and follows this flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Code Push] --> B[CI Setup & Tests]
B --> C[Data Generation]
C --> D[Model Training + Logging]
D --> E[DVC Track + Push]
E --> F[Model Evaluation]
F --> G[Docker Build]
G --> H[Simulated Deployment]
üîß Setup Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone the repo and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/yourname/mlops-github-actions-pipeline.git
cd mlops-github-actions-pipeline

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r app_requirements.txt

# Run DVC (if installed)
dvc init
dvc repro                # If using dvc.yaml pipeline
üìä MLflow Tracking
Local MLflow URI: file:./mlruns

Tracks:

Params (solver, C, etc.)

Metrics (accuracy)

Artifacts (model.pkl, input schema)

python
Copy
Edit
mlflow.log_param('solver', solver)
mlflow.log_metric('accuracy', accuracy)
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(sk_model=model, artifact_path="logistic-model")
Use mlflow ui to explore results locally.

üíæ DVC Integration
DVC is used to version and track:

data/raw_data.csv

models/model.pkl

bash
Copy
Edit
# Track and push data
dvc add data/raw_data.csv
dvc add models/model.pkl
git add data/raw_data.csv.dvc models/model.pkl.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Track data and model with DVC"
dvc remote add -d myremote <remote-url>
dvc push
You can use GitHub, S3, GDrive, or Azure Blob as DVC remote.

üì¶ Docker Packaging
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r app_requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Build locally:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t ml-inference-service .
docker run -p 8080:8080 ml-inference-service
üîÅ GitHub Actions: mlops_pipeline.yml
yaml
Copy
Edit
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  setup_and_test_code:
    ...
  data_prep_and_train:
    ...
  evaluate_and_register_model:
    ...
  package_model:
    ...
  deploy_model:
    ...
Each job:

Installs dependencies

Runs training or evaluation

Verifies artifacts (MLflow, DVC)

Builds Docker image

Simulates deployment

Artifacts from MLflow are uploaded for traceability.

üìà Logging & Monitoring (Pluggable)
You can plug in logging frameworks like:

loguru, logging, wandb, or sentry-sdk

Send logs to CloudWatch / Grafana / Prometheus (via agent sidecars or SDKs)

python
Copy
Edit
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info(f"Training accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
For real monitoring:

Monitor inference time, accuracy drift, input schema violations

Use tools like Evidently, Prometheus + Grafana, or WhyLabs

‚úÖ Run Entire Pipeline
bash
Copy
Edit
# Step 1: Generate data
python generate_data.py

# Step 2: Train model and log with MLflow
python train_model.py

# Step 3: Version artifacts
dvc add data/raw_data.csv
dvc add models/model.pkl
dvc push

# Step 4: (Optional) View MLflow UI
mlflow ui
üß™ Simulated Deployment
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Deployment of Docker image ml-inference-service successful!"
In production, this would involve:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

aws sagemaker create-model

gcloud ai-platform deploy-model

terraform apply

üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements
‚úÖ Real model evaluation script with thresholds

‚úÖ GitHub Secrets for pushing to DockerHub or AWS ECR

‚úÖ Add support for Streamlit app serving

‚è≥ Monitoring dashboard with Grafana or Weights & Biases

Would you like me to:
- Export this as a `README.md` file and include it in your repo?
- Add `badges` (build passing, license, etc.)?
- Add a `dvc.yaml` pipeline as well to automate data ‚Üí model steps?

Let me know what you'd like enhanced!
